# Crack_Detection_CNN



## Use CNN from scratch




Beside building the CNN from scratches, we can also complete this task through [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning), that is applied some famous pre-trained deep neuron network and enhance the power of the CNN. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks. We can reuse the feature extraction functions from some well-trained deep neuron networks, like LeNet, VGG16, Inception V3, ResNet50.

## Use pre-trained [LeNet](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/08/01/lenet-convolutional-neural-network-in-python/)



## Use pre-trained [VGG16](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/)



## Use pre-trained [Inception V3](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced)



## Use pre-trained [ResNet50](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/resnet-residual-neural-network/)
